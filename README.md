### Prereqs :

1) `npm ci` to install exact dependency versions from package-lock.json

2) You must share the sheet's file spreadsheetId@string on Google Drive to the service account provided on Google Cloud Console (hereinafter â€“ GCC) at IAM section (Service Accounts)

3) Once steps 1 & 2 completed, run the command `npm run dev` 

> NOTE : make sure the port in the index.js is freed (unallocated) on your OS, to db-check the port is free , use the command (Windows-oriented solution) : `netstat -an | grep ':443'` # instead of 443 put any other required port to check
